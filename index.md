# About Me

My name is Atefeh and I'm a master student in PERCCOM (Pervasive Computing and Communication for Sustainable Development), an Erasmus Mundus joint master degree sponsered by European Commission. PERCCOM involves studying in 3 main universities in Europe. Starting from France, "Universite de Lorraine", Finland, "Lappeenranta university of technology" and Sweden, "Lule√• university of technology". For the last semester, I'm working on my thesis which is about Software Defined Networking for a green internet communication.
