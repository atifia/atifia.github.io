 After obtaining my bachelor degree and working for ,  years, I decided to continue my studies for a master program in Europe. I was lucky enough to find PERCCOM, a joint master degree by Erasmus Mundus program. PERCCOM is an abbreviation for PERvasive Computing and COMmunication for sustainable development. PERCCOM tries to cover the state-of-the-art trends in computer science and study the potential of this trends to address the environmental issues. As I was an environmental activist, this program was a great match for me. Soon I started PERCCOM with 18 other students from all over the world to join this mission.

 We started our first semester in Nancy a city in the north-east part of France at Universite de Lorraine. In this semester we took part in multiple lectures, courses and seminars from academic and industrial entities. We joined several laboratories about configuring and installing network devices and software along with measuring the carbon dioxide emissions of these devices. In general we grasped a decent view over networking and the technical concept of GreenIT. But it's not all ! From the cultural point of view, we enjoyed the delicacy and great taste of french food, the old history behind the city and the sweet pronunciation of french words.

 Around 2,400 km further, in a very cold winter we arrived in Lappeenranta a small city in Finland. I can confidently say that it was totally different. Food, culture, language and weather !
 When we arrived the winter was showing his generosity for giving us the coldest weather ever. -30 degree was even cold for Finns. But there is one good thing in Finland and it's called Sauna ! Almost all the families have a sauna in their house and it was also provided for students' houses. Although it's super cold, but life still goes on !
 The studies in LUT was mainly about the concepts of GreenIT and the way technology can affect human behavior. We had a course to implement the concepts as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). We all formed groups and developed applications to 1- use the SaaS; 2- to reduce the carbon footprints of people. At the end we had impressive applications to address the daily needs and try to have a long-term impact on users for changing their behavior.

 **3rd Semester- Skelleftea,Sweden**
Being already familiar with the new lifestyle, adapting to another new city was easy. Although the campus is known for the foremost northern university ! This semester was more challenging, filled with laboratories and several tasks and presentations.  And several business and industrial meetings in order to know better the opportunities after studies.
We gained hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services for cloud services and NS-3 simulation for advanced wireless networks which was pretty rich and useful. 
After spending almost one and a half year, now it's time to do the thesis !
